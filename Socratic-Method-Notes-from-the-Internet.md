# Socratic Method - Notes from the Internet


## [Practice the Socratic Method](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-practice-using-the-Socratic-method)

### one
The Socratic Method (to me right now) means to ask any crazy question to see what the response is. If you get good at asking these wild questions and answering them yourself in your head, what you can begin to do this:

1. Hear a position.
2. Ask yourself a bunch of questions about this position in your head and come up with answers to them.
3. Choose the question with the most paradoxical or confusing answer that you came up with, and ask your opponent that question.
4. Repeat.

This will allow you to attack the "weak" points in someone's argument, and if you're wrong, then you'll at least be learning new ways of thinking and how to better judge a fallacy or weak point.

What I feel the best way to use this for is to treat yourself as the opponent. If you start asking hard questions about your own questions, that's when you're really understanding the Method.

### two
Begin with figuring out which answers you are seeking from the audience, then pose your questions as, "Yes, but.....?" responses. I find it useful to sit down and write out several scenarios, with Q&A's that I can anticipate.

Ideally, each question you ask should lead the listener a little further down the path you wish them to follow. Her's an example I use in Traffic/Driver Ed school:
Q: Can you make a right turn on red?
A: Yes
Q: ALWAYS?
A: Yeah, as long as you stop first.
Q: So, as long as you stop first, you can ALWAYS turn right on red?
A: Well, not if there is a sign saying no turn on red.
Q: So, as long as there is no sign, and you always stop first, you can ALWAYS make a right turn on red?
A: Yes, unless there are pedestrians or traffic in your way.
Q: So, summarize for me how, and when, you can make a right turn on red.

By asking, repeating, and building an answer based upon a previous answer, you are better able to get a student or listener to remember the answer (since it came from THEM, not you), as well getting a chance to cover many variables that may exist within your question.

Well in terms of Persuasion, Simple steps can be

1. Ask simple questions that your opponent has to agree with you

2.Collect one yes after the other

3. Continue doing this till your opponent find themselves concluding a point that they themselves rejected a few minutes ago.

1. Figure out what a person's epistimology is. If they think something is true, how do they know it? What are their standards? Warning, people will get angry, defensive and aggressive if you try this too directly. You need to make your point using a person's own standards of evidence.

2. Have some idea of what a person can or can't know. Read about fallacies. There are some that aren't commonly listed, such as a person deriding their opponents views as 'constructs' but then asserting their own views as facts. The switch from a view of social or moral truth as subjective to a view moral truths as objective is an important thing to note.

This will help you see the fault lines in someone's argument.

3. Understand the difference between an objective fact and a taxonomical categorization. "The Map is not the Territory."

4. Find really intelligent people who make absurd claims. Listen to how they support their claims. Try to figure out counter-arguments. Listen to the counter-arguments that other people make. This will give you a better understanding of the process of argumentation. It's also a great way to understand a subject.

There are more emotionally effective methods of persuasion (agreeing with people, feel felt found, etc.) but the above should help with the logical side of things.
